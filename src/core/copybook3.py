# Copybook structure
# The layout of a copybook follows the file layout of Cobol.
# This means that columns have specific uses and this also needs
# to be followed in the Copybook.
# Columns 1-6 are left empty and are where the line numbers were stored on cards.
# This area is called the Sequence number area and is ignored by the compiler.
# Next we have the indicator area which is a single column (7).
# This column is mainly used to indicate if that line is a comment.
# As seen above. However it also has a few other characters such as /, -, and D.
# They have the following effects: a comment that w will be printed, the line
# continues from the previous one, and enables that line in debugging mode.
# Area A (8-11) contains the level numbers such as 01 and 10 in our example.
# After 01 it does not matter the exact numbers used for ordering.
# However, the level numbers do need to be larger than any sections below.
# Columns 12-72 are called Area B and that contains any other code not allowed in
# Area A. This contains the name of the field in the above example that continues
# to around column 25. Next is the definition of the datatype.
# Described in the next section.
# 73+ is the program name area. Historically the max was 80 due to punch cards.
# It is used to identify the sequence of the card.

# Summarizing:
# 1-6: Sequence number area
# 7: Indicator area
# 8-11: Level number area
# 12-72: Area B â†’ Name of the field, datatype, etc.
# 73+: Program name area
